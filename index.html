    <h1>F² MicroTools</h1>
    <p>This site is an index to a series of small tools that are meant to be easy, simple tools to respond to a simple need.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><a href="/LocalSlideshow/">LocalSlideshow</a> lets you open a local folder few (or a lot) of image files and it lets you watch them, with a few options such as random and different speed.</li>
      <li><a href="/LocalPhotoSphere/">LocalPhotoSphere</a> lets you open photosphere locally to view it.</li>
      <li><a href="/LocalVideoWall/">LocalVideoWall</a> lets you open a bunch of local video files and watch them all at once.</li>
      <li><a href="/LocalVideoWallPlaylist/">LocalVideoWallPlaylist</a> lets you open a bunch of local video files and watch them all at once. This is a different twist from the previous as it uses a fixed grid and manages a repeating playlist rather than fitting all of the videos on the wall at once.</li>
      <li><a href="/LocalAudioWall/">LocalAudioWall</a> lets you open a bunch of local audio files and play them all at once.</li>

     </ol>

    <p>These microtools are designed to be minimal. This mean there is no tracking and I cannot know how popular those tools are. <a href="mailto:microtools@mayetsoft.fr">Let me know what you liked (or not). Drop me a line. Like, now!</a></p>
